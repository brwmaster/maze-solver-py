# Maze Solver Project with Python and Tkinter

## Overview

This project is a maze solver application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to visualize and solve mazes using different algorithms.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create mazes of various sizes and complexities.
- **Algorithmic Solvers:** Implement and visualize maze-solving algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter for an engaging experience.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch the algorithm solve the maze step by step.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brwmaster/maze-solver-py.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd maze-solver-py
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- Run the application and use the GUI to:
  - Generate a new maze.
  - Choose an algorithm to solve the maze.
  - Visualize the maze-solving process step by step.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main application file.
- `window.py`: Generates a new window class.
